## Sample process
If your images and boundary/region samples are unsegmented<br>  

put the entire image and samples in the:  
`<ImageDataset/data>`  

and   
`python sample_process.py`   <br>

**sample_process.py** can segment the whole image and samples into sample tiles 
and calculate the distance samples  

Note: Please check the path in the **sample_process.py**.  


## Requirements
`PyTorch  
TensorboardX  
GDAL  
OpenCV   
PIL  
numpy  
tqdm  
scikit-learn`  <br>

The code is tested under a Linux desktop with torch 1.2.0 and Python 3.6 <br>


## Run the model
Train model:<br>
`python train.py`<br>

prediction:<br>
`python predict_boundary.py      
python predict_region.py`<br>

## Pretrained weight
Here we provide the pretrained model, which trained on the training areas of Bincheng County:<br>
[Google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RULXp_hifjleM-GavclJsPaLV042KwgS/view?usp=drive_link), and [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1KUKZlVy4aicExLfoxhPhxg?pwd=bnu9) (code:bnu9)
